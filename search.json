    "text": "Learning activities\n\nClass format\nEach weekly class will comprise approximately 90 minutes of lecture and discussion and approximately 60 minutes of computational or data-driven laboratory. Slides will drive each lecture, but they will serve mainly as a framework and reference material for the class. The expectation is that students will come prepared to engage and ask questions, since much of the semester will be focused on foundational concepts that require thinking and understanding. Questions and discussion are the gateway to understanding and intuition.\n\nReadings and pre-work\nReadings, case studies and other pre-work will be assigned every week to introduce you to the topic of the week. It is essential that you complete this prior to class and are prepared to participate and engage in class. These materials will be made available on Canvas and on the website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou must read the readings and complete the pre-work prior to class time so you are prepared to participate in class.\n\n\n\n\nCase studies and laboratory work\nWe will discuss concepts, theory and methods most weeks, and have a laboratory section discussing both conceptual and technical aspects every week. These laboratory sessions will use JASP initially, and then R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\nYou will start the labs in class but you will most likely not finish. It is your responsibility to complete the labs to enable your learning. Completing the labs succesfully is also part of your grade.\n\n\n\n\n\nEngagement and participation\nWe don’t expect merely token participation (just asking simple or rhetorical questions) but high quality content in the engagements. You are all high-quality students, and this is the expectation we carry. There are several ways we would like to interact with you:\n\nParticipation during class, asking questions, clarifying doubts, and even answering your classmate’s questions\nEach class will have a discussion on Canvas, for each section. Each student will do a “muddy water” exercise after each lecture, highlighting in short paragraphs (a) one thing that clicked for you in class, (b) one thing that remains confusing (especially conceptual topics), and (c) one thing that you think might have been done in class to improve your understanding\nEach lecture will have an associated Google document that everyone can edit. The intent is to have a shared set of notes generated by you so that we can co-learn and co-create through class. These will be living documents where we all share our understanding of the topic(s) at hand.\n\nWe will keep track of who is contributing to the class as a baseline evaluation, but full credit can be obtained with higher quality questions, comments, independent ideas, evidence of analytic thinking, and insights that help us all understand. We’re really looking forward to this aspect of the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\nClasses and labs will not be recorded. The best way to learn and benefit from this class is in-person participation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomework assignments\nThere will be several homework assignments. The goal of these problem sets is to solidify concepts and learning objectives each week, as we build skills and knowledge throughout the semester These will typically involve a set of questions to reinforce the conceptual material of the week, and a set of coding/analysis exercises to solidify their implementation. Submissions will typically be done on Canvas. We will introduce Quarto as the primary tool for writing and submitting your work, which will allow us a single means of both textual and coding submissions.\nThe intent of the homework is to reinforce concepts, but not be overly burdensome. These will generally be thinking exercises. A grading rubric will be provided for all assignments.\nHomework assignments will be published after class, and will be due the following Sunday by 11:59pm Eastern time (but see the calendar for any deviations)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the submission requirements and the late policy for this class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSince this is a graduate-level class, we expect students to want to learn and not search online for answers. See the Academic Integrity section for more details.\n\n\n\n\nOnline Quizzes\nWe will often have quizzes to ensure that the pre-work material has been absorbed. These will be graded for completion.\nThere will be unannounced quizzes a few times during the semester, at random intervals and times. The quizzes ensure you are keeping up with the material presented in the class. The material for the quizzes will be drawn from lectures, labs, and readings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMissed quizzes cannot be made up.",

Over the course of the semester you will work towards creating an analytic project relevant to the program of study that will incorporate visualization, inference and prediction through the use of data science techniques. Details will be available in the project website. by week 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe project will have several milestones that are cumulative in nature. Therefore, we will grade the project after the final submission with a holistic project rubric. We will grade the milestones in a qualitative way, and we will provide feedback and a trending grade with each milestone. It is up to you to incorporate the feedback provided. If your milestone trending grade is lower than you expected, and you do not incorporate the feedback we provide for improvement, do not expect your final project grade to improve.\n\n\nTotal is 100 points and the final grade will be based on the scale below.

Reasons for failing include but are not limited to:\n\nConsistently delivering work that is significantly below expectations\nConsistently missing deliverables\nConsistently missing class\nBeing found in violation of academic integrity\n\n\n\n\nGrading philosophy\nSome of the assignments you will work on are open-ended and some are not (i.e. specific tasks). Grading is generally holistic, meaning that there may not always be specific point value for individual elements of a deliverable. Each deliverable submission is unique and will be compared to all other submissions.\nDeliverables that:\n\nExceed the requirements and expectations are typically considered A level work.\nJust meet the requirements and expectations are typically considered B to A- level work.\nDo not meet the requirements are typically considered B- or lesser level work.\n\nPartial credit will be given where appropriate.\nAll deliverables must meet general quality requirements that are expected from students at the graduate school level as well as specific requirements that will be provided for each deliverable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPortions of each assignment may be programmatically graded. To facilitate this, it is essential that folder structures and file names exactly match what the provided directions state. Failure to do so makes grading more difficult and time-consuming, especially in a class with over 100 students, and will lead to partial point deductions.\n\n\nPoints will be deducted for any of the following reasons:\n\nYour technical approach is fundamentally flawed\nYour analytical decisions are unjustified\nYou did not follow any direct and specific instructions\nYou do not have proper spelling and grammar in the textual parts of the assignment \nYour deliverable has missing sections\nYour overall presentation and/or writing is sloppy \nYou use incorrect file names (wrong extensions, wrong case, etc.)",

Please be punctual and respectful and remain for the full period until excused.\nGiven the technical nature of this course, and the breadth of topics discussed, you are expected to attend each class, to complete all readings, and to participate actively in lectures, discussions and exercises. We understand there may be times you may need to miss class; please inform us in advance if you are not able to attend class for any reason so we can provide class materials and also prepare for a smaller classroom experience. However, it is up to you to keep up.\nPlease don’t take advantage of my sympathy and empathy. There are legitimate reasons for missing class, including illness, family emergencies, and unavoidable work situations. Let me know as soon as you can if you will not be able to attend class.\n\n\nParticipation\nWe love participation. Read. Raise your hand. Ask questions. Make comments. Challenge us. Acknowledge us. If we speak for three hours to a silent classroom, it is a lot more boring and tiring for everyone.\n\n\nLaptop and phone use\nYou must bring your laptop to class to work on labs. No phone use is allowed during lecture.\nWe would prefer that during class time, you use your laptops for class-specific activities, including analyses, on-the-fly searches for understanding and note-taking. This class is not easy, so your attention and focus will help you succeed.\n\n\nCommunication and Slack Rules\n\nAll announcements will be posted on Canvas and Slack\nUse Slack for any question you may have about the course, about assignments or any technical issue. This way everyone can learn from each others questions. We will be monitoring and providing answers on a regular basis. Make sure you understand what is allowed in Slack.\nAll communication with the professor should be either on general Slack channels or via the abhijit.dasgupta@gerogetown.edu email. *. E-mail is preferred for any communication of a personal nature as opposed to questions about class materials.\n\nSlack DMs are not to be used unless we DM you first and you can respond to our message. Students may not initiate DMs.\nAny email sent to the instructor containing any course question that is not personal in nature will not be answered; these are expected to go on Slack for general discussion and peer contributions.\nE-mails of a personal nature (personal issues or difficulties, questions regarding grades, seeking help with a personal issue, etc.) should be sent to the instructors’ e-mail (abhijit.dasgupta@gerogetown.edu).\n\nKeep an eye on the questions posted in Slack. Use the search function. It’s very possible that we have already answered a question, and we reserve the right to point you to the syllabus, previous Slack messages, or other document containing the information requested.\nAssignment, lab and project questions will only be answered on Slack up to 12 hours before something is due.\n\n\n\nOpen Door Policy\nPlease approach or get in touch with me if something is not working for you regarding the class, methods, etc. My pledge to you is to provide the best learning experience possible. If you have any issue please do not wait until the last minute to speak with us. I care deeply about your learning and success.\nIf you are struggling in any way, reach out so we can consider accommodations to improve your experience. Let me know early and often how you’re doing. I will also be checking in. There are many resources that you can avail if you are going to physical or mental issues. Please reach out and I’m ready to help.",

These tools can help us be more effective and we embrace their use.\nHowever (and you know there’s a ‘however’), using GAI tools in place of thinking and gaining experience is not fruitful for you and will not serve you well. Intuition and understanding is gained by thinking, ruminating and discussing, not by the short-term objective of completing assignments and getting points. The concepts and tools we are exploring in this class will affect most aspects of your future career, and learning them well will benefit you. Inappropriate use of data and data scientific tools results in a “garbage in, garbage out” situation that can affect decisions and can cost time and money.

Note: non-native English speakers cannot use gen-ai to fully translate content written in another language.\nUsing it to assimilate openly available resources (papers, blogs, etc) that can allow you a launching pad to understand a topic. However, it is a case of “buyer beware” in terms of the reliability and veracity of the sources that ge-ai uses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAny deviation from these rules is considered a violation of academic integrity and will be acted on.\nYou typically KNOW when you are crossing the line into un-ethical territory.

All Honor Code violations will be submitted to the Honor Council.\nAcademic integrity is central to the learning and teaching process. Students are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that will contribute to the maintenance of academic integrity by making all reasonable efforts to prevent the occurrence of academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty includes (but is not limited to) obtaining or giving aid on an examination, having unauthorized prior knowledge of an examination, doing work for another student, and plagiarism of all types, including copying code.\nPlagiarism is the intentional or unintentional presentation of another person’s idea or product as one’s own. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to the following: copying verbatim all or part of another’s written work; using phrases, charts, figures, illustrations, code, or mathematical/scientific solutions without citing the source; paraphrasing ideas, conclusions, or research without citing the source; and using all or part of a literary plot, poem, film, musical score, or other artistic product without attributing the work to its creator. Students can avoid unintentional plagiarism by following carefully accepted scholarly practices. Notes taken for papers and research projects should accurately record sources cited, quoted, paraphrased, or summarized sources and articles should be acknowledged in footnotes.\n\n\nHonor System\nAll students are expected to maintain the highest standards of academic and personal integrity in pursuit of their education at Georgetown. Academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, in any form, is a serious offense, and students found in violation are subject to academic penalties that include, but are not limited to, failure of the course, termination from the program, and revocation of degrees already conferred. All students are held to the Georgetown University Honor Code.

Georgetown requires faculty members unless otherwise designated as confidential, to report all disclosures of sexual misconduct to the University Title IX Coordinator or a Deputy Title IX Coordinator. Suppose you disclose an incident of sexual misconduct to a professor in or outside of the classroom (except disclosures in papers). In that case, that faculty member must report the incident to the Title IX Coordinator or Deputy Title IX Coordinator. The coordinator will, in turn, reach out to the student to provide support, resources, and the option to meet—[Please note that the student is not required to meet with the Title IX coordinator.]. More information about reporting options and resources can be found on the Sexual Misconduct Website.\nIf you would prefer to speak to someone confidentially, Georgetown has a number of fully confidential professional resources that can provide support and assistance.

    "text": "Use of git\n‘git’ is the most popular version control tool used today. It is very important that you are fluent in the tool and the process.\n\nYou must use git commands to add files to your repositories on your machine. This includes git clone, git pull, git push, git add and git commit.You may use git functionality within your IDE (VSCode, RStudio, Positron, etc.) which runs git commands for you. You cannot manually upload files to your repositories on GitHub.\nWe expect to see several commits in all your work. This is important for several reasons:\n\nIt shows the progress in your work\nIt helps you revert back to a prior “snapshot” of your work in case anything goes wrong. Murphy’s law says that if something can go wrong, it will.\nGenerally the rule is to commit often with small-ish commits and a descriptive commit message, and then push to GitHub at the end of your work or your day. Small commits make it easier to go back without losing too much work.\n\n\nSee https://happygitwithr.com for a nice data science centric approach to git.",
